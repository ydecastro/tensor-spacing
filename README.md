# tensor-spacing
This is a Python package for the article `Second maximum of a Gaussian random field and exact (t-)spacing test` by Jean-Marc Azaïs, Federico Dalmao and Yohann De Castro. It illustrates the method of testing for the existence of **low-rank tensors** within a noisy observation. While our procedure is not specifically designed to detect low rank structures, it is applicable to **ALL** alternatives. However, it is particularly powerful when applied to low rank alternatives.

## Main module

1. **tensor_spacing.py**: implementation of spacing test.

## Jupyter Notebooks

1. [**spacing_tensors.ipynb**](https://github.com/ydecastro/tensor-spacing/blob/main/3way_3dim_case/spacing_tensors.ipynb) : Demonstrates spacing test in the case of symmetric tensors.

## Reference
This notebook is based on the article:
